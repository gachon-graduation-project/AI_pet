The two-way interaction will be structured to receive an input through image recognition through openCV and provide an output value for the input. The formalized Pet patterns the reactions, builds a database, and responds based on it.

## Personalized Reaction

For personalization, we use reinforcement learning to calculate the weight that fits the owner and proceed with personalization. Create a database by patterning and change the response and pattern to suit the user. This is called unity ML agent. (unity ML agent is a tool for reinforcement learning.)
 Reinforcement learning is customized to the user. Through transfer learning, the weight of the pre-trained model is gradually changed in the real world to personalize it, which greatly reduces the actual learning time, so you can expect fast responses and fast reward algorithm updates.
